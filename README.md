# mousikegram
I have a music-sharing chat with some friends. Given the size of the group, we all use a few different streaming services,
so instead of sharing screenshots I figured it would be nice to be able to automatically translate the links between them
where possible.

At the moment, mousikegram only does Spotify -> Youtube.

Many thanks to the excellent folks over at [python-telegram-bot](https://github.com/python-telegram-bot/python-telegram-bot) and 
[spotipy.](https://github.com/plamere/spotipy).

This project is intended for python3.6+ (I love `fstrings`.)
